# Hi! ::sunglasses:

This repository contains different types of login. Some of then contain browser session that show information about all the devices/browsers that made login with a user

If you want to use it change the .env.example file and configure the DB options. In my case, I use mysql to store the data about users. I have the models for users, so you can migrate all the tables that are necessary.

**IMPORTANT:** Need to have php, composer and laravel installed on the device. Here you have a tutorial to install composer and laravel: [Link Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsx1xPURdc8&ab_channel=Webslesson).
